How to start an app
In the correct folder, TYPE "rails new Filename" (this will create a new rails directory)
cd into the new rails directory
rails g controller Pages home (g == generate)

OR

TYPE "rails g scaffold Filename title:string notes:text due:date done:boolean" (ALWAYS make the filename SINGULAR because rails will make it plural later)

rails server (starts your server)

In browser, go to http://localhost:3000/pages/home
